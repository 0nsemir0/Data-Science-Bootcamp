## Practice Questions#
1. How do you assess the statistical significance of an insight?
  --> use the p value and try hypothesis testing. If the p-value is less than the threshhold, the result is statistically significant, 
  which means the null hypothesis might not be valid. This suggests that the insight is not due to random chance. 
2. What is the Central Limit Theorem? Explain it. Why is it important?
  The central limit theorem means that the bigger the sample size, the more the distribution will become normal. It lets us know use
normal distribution approximation even when the population is unknown or not normal. 
3. What is the statistical power?
It is the probability that a statistical test will correctly reject false null hypothesises. 
4. How do you control for biases?
  Biases can be lowered using blinding, randomization, and control groups. In the data scientist's mindset, it is normally randomizing
  the test and the training data. 
5. What are confounding variables?
  Confounding variables are factors that effect both independent and dependent variables, that might make it seem like there is a relationship in between.
6. What is A/B testing?
  It is a method of comparing two versions of a variable to determine which one is better. Groups are randomly assigned and measured. 
7. What are confidence intervals?
  It is a range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence.
